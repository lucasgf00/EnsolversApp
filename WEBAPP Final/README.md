## Content
I made this website to create a task list, it has a login and you can edit the files.
## Accessibility
There is a bash script to make a DB, also to log in as an 'admin' you need to use: 

"username: admin | password: 123" or like an user: "username: user | password: 123"
## Notes
  - Run the bash "dbBashGF" to create the schema DB for running the app, else
    
    you can open the .bash with a text editor like 'gedit', copy the code and
    
    manually create the DB.
  - The logging system is made with an encrypted pass.
  - As and admin you can edit, delete and save 'tasks', however as user you only can watch entities.
  - If your text editor (Apache netBeans, Eclipse IDE, etc.) has 'HTML error checking' please disable it

    for a better reading experience.
## Run
To run this website you need the DataBase already created and go to the 'localhost:8080' port into your browser.
